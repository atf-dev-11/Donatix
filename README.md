# DNS Detection and Analytics Freeware

## Overview
DNS Detection and Analytics is released as an open-source tool to enable users to make sense of DNS data, analyse user behaviour and detect cybersecurity risks. It comes bundled with a no-restriction right to use of AttackFence's Threat Intelligence Cloud for threat detection.

### Analytics Features
- Conversation Summary: Understand communication patterns between hosts, helping you identify normal and potentially suspicious interactions.

- Query/Response Summary: Gain insights into the overall DNS traffic flow, enabling you to assess the health and efficiency of your network.

- Query Type Breakup: Analyze the types of queries to better understand the nature of DNS requests and potential areas of interest.

- Response Code Breakup: Identify and troubleshoot issues by examining response codes, ensuring a smooth DNS resolution process.

- Query Name Length: Detect anomalies or potential security threats by analyzing variations in query name lengths.

- Label Count Length: Understand label count distributions, aiding in the identification of irregularities in DNS query structures.

- TTL Value: Optimize DNS performance and reliability by analyzing Time-to-Live (TTL) values.
- Conversation Summary by TLD: Profile DNS conversations by top-level domain, providing insights into the origin and nature of traffic.

- DGA Summary: Detect potential threats by identifying hosts exhibiting behaviour indicative of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA).

### Detection Features
- Beaconing Detection: 
Identify hosts engaging in continuous outbound DNS traffic, a potential sign of beaconing, using a 24-hour timeframe.

- DNS Tunneling Detection: 
Spot abnormal DNS tunneling activities, safeguarding against potential security breaches.

- DGA Detection: 
Detect hosts using Domain Generation Algorithms to generate malicious domain names, providing an early warning of potential threats.

- IOC Correlation: 
Correlate domain names and IP addresses with AttackFence Threat Intel, enhancing your ability to identify and mitigate threats effectively.

## Installation & Prerequisites

The installers check for the following prerequisites and install whatever is missing:

- Python: DNS Detection and Analytics requires Python. If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The version must be lower than or equal to 3.11
  Download the exe file and run it on your system
- Wireshark: Although the package only requires Tshark but in Windows operating system you need to download the executable file of Wireshark from the Wireshark official [Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). The tshark will be installed with it as well.
- Python packages: aiohttp and matplotlib (matplotlib generates the PDF report).

## Usage
### For Windows.
  - Run Donatix.exe from Windows Directory. It installs the project to C:\Donatix, installs any missing prerequisite (Python, Wireshark, aiohttp, matplotlib) and creates the scheduled tasks.
  - To run from a source checkout instead of installing, run install.bat from Windows Directory (it asks for administrator rights).
  - Donatix.exe is built from Donatix.iss with Inno Setup (```ISCC.exe Donatix.iss```) and must be rebuilt after changing any script.
    - Open task schedular application and go into the task schedular library and Run the following tasks with highest privileges.
      -   DNSDataAnalytics.
      -   TiAnalytics.
      -   findBeaconingHosts.
      -   DGAEvaluation.
      -   findDnsTunnelingHosts.
      -   TsharkQuery
      
### For Linux.
  - Run ``` sudo ./installPackages.sh ``` from Linux Directory.

## Uninstall
  - Windows: run uninstall.bat from Windows Directory (it asks for administrator rights).
  - Linux: run ``` sudo bash uninstall.sh ``` from Linux Directory.

Both remove the scheduled tasks / services and the installed scripts, and ask before deleting the captured DNS data. The prerequisites (Python, Wireshark/Tshark, aiohttp, matplotlib and the other packages) are left installed.

## PDF Report
The analytics and detections are published as a PDF, generated on demand from the captured data.

  - Windows: run ```python generateReport.py``` from the Windows\scripts\src directory.
  - Linux: run ```sudo -u attackfence python3 /opt/attackfence/Donatix/Linux/scripts/src/generateReport.py -o /tmp/Donatix_Report.pdf```

Options:
  - ```-o report.pdf``` : where to write the report (default: Donatix_Report_<date>.pdf in the current directory).
  - ```--days N``` : only report on the last N days (default: all captured data).

Report contents:
  - Page 1, Overview: number of DNS queries, responses, hosts, domains queried, DGA domains and malicious/suspicious indicators, and queries/responses over time.
  - Page 2, Traffic Breakdown: query types (A, AAAA, PTR, ...), response codes, top level domains and DNS servers by queries.
  - Page 3, Hosts and Domains: top domains, queries by host, distinct domains visited by host, and query name length, label count and TTL statistics.
  - Page 4, Threat Intelligence and DGA Detection: threat intel verdicts, flagged indicators, DGA queries by host and DGA domains.
  - Page 5, Beaconing and DNS Tunneling Detection: beaconing hosts and DNS tunneling domains.
